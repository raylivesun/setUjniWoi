(*It would be like this in Wolfram Languages ​​if I use an abstract to restrain the arguments 
of natural numbers, the gamma of zeta would be to understand the natural numbers, but this 
is only necessary if your numbers are not complex inverses of gamma over zeta.*)

(*let's say that if the current that is over the gamma expression it is a space of time over 
another current but both do not have complexes over the path their complexes are over the 
arguments and the canonicals which are the part of arguments derived by the deltas.*)

(* the system it highlights about wolfram languages ​​wafer cookies about gamma and zeta

connection of relativity, let's say that zeta and gamma about relativity in passivist
